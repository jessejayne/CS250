class repo for cs250 - software dev lifecycle 



    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      
      - Interpreting user needs and implementing them are highly important parts of the software development lifecycle. They could essentially be considered
      the entire point of the lifecycle existing. The product owner, or team member who meets with and records the user needs from the customer, has to be able
      to communicate with the non-technical people and convert that into tasks that the technical team members can act on. Creating "user stories" can help
      by giving a more well-rounded context to the customer's needs and putting them into perspective of the final product. Having each of these tasks as a 
      separate user story can also help with assigning the work to individual developers, or help with making changes later on when the customer changes 
      their mind on what they need.
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
      - In approaching developing programs, I've found that starting with the right framework, mindset, and plan, are key to success. Learning about the 
      scrum-agile process and what it offers to a company or developer has certainly expanded my horizons on what is possible in the lifecycle of 
      developing programs. I now consider what the finished product will look like, what it will take to get there, and try to think of features that 
      the customer will really want that they may not have even been able to think of or explain themselves. The planning and organizational processes and 
      frameworks from agile/scrum, such as the burn-down charts, daily scrum meetings, and communication techniques are absolutely something that will stick
      with me and I hope to bring to whatever team or company I end up with. 
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
      - Being a good team member in this industry means being a good communicator and a leader. Even in a junior or individual development role, when a person
      might not technically be overseeing anyone else, they have the responsibility to display good leadership techniques. Taking ownership of problems,
      delivering a quality product, and communicating completed work to the team are key aspects of a succesful team. Keeping the product moving forward and the 
      team filled in on progress helps everyone else to have an eye on the end goal, and to keep track of changes as they occur. Utilizing agile or similar 
      frameworks can help with these tasks and ideals, but instilling them in oneself in every aspect of teamwork is essential and the true goal.
